Machine Learning Overview

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems 
to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

Types of Machine Learning:
1. Supervised Learning - Training with labeled data
2. Unsupervised Learning - Finding patterns in unlabeled data  
3. Reinforcement Learning - Learning through trial and error

Common algorithms include decision trees, neural networks, and support vector machines.
Applications range from image recognition to natural language processing.
